#    batch job is currently in progress, without any race conditions.)
#
# 2. 'batch.log' must be deleted only after 'batch.todo' has been marked as
#    done by renaming it 'batch.done'. This way, if the 'batch.todo' job ever
#    crashes, it can always be resumed (since the logfile will always exist).
